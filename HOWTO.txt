CasparPlay Client
=================

	CasparPlay is a client for CasparCG Server derived from CasparCG Client. It contains few
additional features on top of stock CasparCG Client available on github.com/casparcg/client.
This client is meant to work with CCGClient (github.com/CasparPlay/ccgclient), CCGClient works
as a server for CasparPlay Client and acts as client for the CasparCG Server. Features included
in this CasparPlay Client are below:

		a/ Prepare Rundown
		b/ Generate Report
		c/ Send To Database
		d/ Text Scroller

	a) PREPARE RUNDOWN: This option could be found under "File" menu. This option is
	meant to work with Razuna Asset Management System. A "Open File" window will appear
	and will accept a .txt file with name of clips/videos. After selecting the file, all
	the necessary information regarding the video files will appear. This will allow user
	to check to make sure whether the video informations are correct or not. If infor-
	mations are correct in that case "Confirm Playlist" needs to be pressed and it will
	send commands to the "copyer" daemon (see it's documentation for more info) which is
	responsible for copying the video files into CasparCG server media path.

	b) GENERATION REPORT: This feature is yet to fully develop. This feature basically
	sends a command to the CCGClient (See it's documentation for details) for a particular
	date and CCGClient returns back commercial name and what time it was played on.

	c) SEND TO DATABASE: This feature is developed to sent playlist to the casparcg server's
	MySQL database. CCGClient on that server will be responsible for playout the videos. Stock
	casparcg client movie widget has been modified and two more option i) Timecode (when this
	video will be played) ii) Commercial (whether that particular video is a commercial or not)
	has been added. Timecode is to be used as start time of the video and should only be used
	for the first video.

	d) TEXT SCROLLER: This feature is a news scrolling feature. News displaying backend is
	based on AKCESS template found on CasparCG forum. Front end has been changed but the
	backend remains same.


SETTING UP CASPARCG SERVER FOR FAILOVER/REDUNDANCY:
===================================================
	One of the main reasons for developing CasparPlay and CCGClient is to make sure redundancy.
To make sure playout continues in 24x7 style we had to setup two CasparCG servers one as primary
and a shadow server as secondary server. We wanted to setup servers in such a way if primary goes
down as if secondary server continues playing. With stock CasparCG client available it's possible
to achieve this. But, there's two problem -
		a) In case of one server goes off, other server continues playing but when the
		dead server is up for running it skips the video that other server is playing
		instead it picks the next video and therefore breaks the sequence. So, at the time
		of recovery failed server doesn't sync up with the other server.

		b) The other problem is if for some reason CasparCG Client fails, playout might
		stop due to the fact that server will not get any commands from the client.

In according to deal with the above problems we developed CasparPlay client and a BackToBack client
known as CCGClient. CasparPlay client is modified version of CasparCG client and CCGClient is a
python script which continuously fetches videos from a database. CasparPlay has a feature to send
playlist into database (described above) therefore even if it's not available or goes down playout
will continue. CCGClient can be found at https://github.com/CasparPlay/CCGClient and how to configure
can be found at that link. Following steps are required for configuring as failover:

		1. Download CCGClient from https://github.com/CasparPlay/CCGClient.
		2. Download and install the prerequisites a/ Python-2.7, b/ MySQL-python-2.7 and
		    c/ MySQL 5.6.

		3. Create a database name casparcg and dump the schema.sql file found under
		   CCGClient.

		4. Configure the sample configuration file csclient.ini could be found under
		   AppData\Local.

		   A sample configuration file is like below:

			[General]
			buddyip=192.168.152.8
			buddydbname=casparcg
			buddydbuser=dbuser
			buddydbpass=password
			serverip=127.0.0.1
			serverdbname=casparcg
			serverdbuser=dbuser
			serverdbpass=password
			logpath=casparcgserver\log

		   buddyip is the ipaddress of the redundant server used for backup, buddydbname
		   is the database name created by the script, buddydbuser and buddydbpass are the
		   username and password of buddy database, respectively. Likewise - serverip,
		   serverdbname, serverdbpass, serverdbuser are host server ip, database name,
		   database password and database username, respectively. And, finally logpath is
		   the location of the directory of the log files.

		5. CasparCG Configuration: CasparCG "Predifined Clients" needs to be configured
		   properly. On the main server, buddy server IP, Port no 7250 (fixed as of now)
		   needs to be configured as Predifined Client and vice-versa for the buddy server.

		6. Start the CasparCG server.

		7. Now run CCGClient.py script.

		8. Add the servers IP on CasparPlay client and mark one server as shadow also fill
		   up the Database Username and Password field.

		Above steps should be appropriate for setting up two CasparCG server for redundancy.

CONFIGURING CASPARPLAY WITH RAZUNA:
===================================
	1. Download and install razuna from razuna.org and run razuna (follow razuna's manual on
	   how to do it).

	2. Create a razuna user and copy it's API key from the user's "My Info" section.

	3. In CasparPlay, open it's "Settings" window, goto Razuna section, click on "+" icon a
	   small window will appear, give a name and paste the api key. Now CasparPlay is ready
	   to fetch metadata from razuna and it will be displayed when PREPARE RUNDOWN option is
	   invoked.

	4. Finally, download copyer program from https://github.com/CasparPlay/Copyer. Compile and
	   run it as:
		./copyer -d "media path of the mounted casparcgserver"

	If CasparPlay isn't configured with Razuna then "Prepare Rundown" option will not work.
	Note that, it'll take a file name as input - which should contain the clip names and these
	clip names must be same as how they are named while keeping at Razuna. Upon confirmation
	of "Confirm Playlist" it'll start copying the media files from razuna to CasparCG media
	path. Then those media files will be displayed on "Videos" section and are ready for creat-
	ing playlist.
